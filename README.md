# Libft
Welcome to my Libft repository, the first major project I completed as a student at 42. This project focuses on strengthening foundational programming skills by reimplementing key functions from the C standard library.

Libft includes custom versions of several essential C functions and additional utility functions designed to support more advanced projects. The primary goals were to gain a deeper understanding of how common library functions work under the hood and to build a reusable library that will be used throughout future projects at 42.
